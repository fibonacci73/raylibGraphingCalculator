# Graphing Calculator in C using Raylib

## Description
This is a work-in-progress **graphing calculator** written in C and built with [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/).  
It can draw up to **seven functions** and supports **sin, cos, tan, square roots, absolute values, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division**.  
It also features **variable scaling** and can compute **intersections** between any two functions.

## Features
- Plot up to **7 functions** simultaneously  
- Support for basic trigonometric functions, arithmetic operations, square roots and absolute values  
- Adjustable viewing window and scale  
- Intersection detection between two functions  

## Installation
You can download the [game.exe](graphingCalculator.exe) file if you only want to run the program.  
To edit the source code, download the [latest release](https://github.com/fibonacci73/raylibGraphingCalculator/releases/tag/v0.1.0) and edit the [Makefile](Makefile) by inserting your raylib installation path (e.g.  
`RAYLIB_PATH ?= C://raylib/raylib`).

## How to Use
When you open the application, navigate the menus using the **arrow keys**, **Enter**, and **Esc**.  
Select a field and press **Enter** to edit it; press **Del** to delete a function.

You can write expressions such as:
- `x^2 + 4`
- `sin(x)`
- `|x|`
- `r(x)` for square roots

Press **Esc** to return to the input menu and **Spacebar** to draw the functions.

### Additional Controls
- Press **G** to open the **Gsolve** menu and compute intersections  
- Press **V** to open the **vWindow** menu and edit the scale values  
  (use **Backspace** to delete digits)
